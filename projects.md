## Other Projects

### Digit Detection and Classification in Natural Scene

Created end to end pipeline for finding and classifying digits within a natural image scene. Utilized a combination of sliding window, Gaussian pyramid, HoG descriptors, SVM, and
non-maximal suppression for detecting digits. Used VGG16 and custom CNN architecture for classification. Implemented using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.
   
### OpenAI Lunar Lander

Implemented Google DeepMind reinforcement learning algorithm to train an OpenAI Lunar Lander agent to consistently land successfully using Keras
